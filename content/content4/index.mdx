## **Gatsby**

**Pros**

 1. **Fast websites** - *Websites utilzing **Gatsby** are on average 2-3x faster than websites from other competing frameworks.*

 2. **Plugin rich** - *The **Gatsby** ecosystem is rich,  setting up a website takes just a matter of minutes with the number of available plugins.*

 3. **High security** - ***Gatsby** does not allow direct communication with the database, user data, and other sensitive information, allowing websites built with this frame work to be more secure.*


**Cons**

 1. **Content-heavy websites** -  *Generating a static version on **Gatsby** takes a long time, even for small websites the time increase for larger websites can be exponential.*

 2. **Constant content updation** - *Updates do not happen in real time as it happens in other frameworks.*
